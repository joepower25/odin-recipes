    <h4>Creamy and cheesy Buffalo-flavored chicken baked ziti!</h4>
    <div class="list"
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces ziti pasta</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Buffalo Wing sauce (such as Frank's Red Hot)</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix
            <li>3/4 pound cooked, shredded chicken breast meat</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>3 stalks green onions, chopped</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <ol>
            <li>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>3. While the ziti is cooking, melt butter in a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until golden, about 2 minutes. Add flour and whisk to combine; cook for 1 minute. Add heavy cream and whisk until no clumps remain; bring to a simmer. Be careful not to curdle the cream--adjust temperature if necessary; simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>4. Add cream cheese; break up with a wooden spoon until combined and melted. Stir in Buffalo sauce and ranch seasoning until combined.</li>
            <li>5. Drain ziti and add to the skillet with shredded chicken; stir until coated. Top with Cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li>6. Bake in the preheated oven until Cheddar is melted and golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Garnish with green onions and serve.</li>
        </ol>
